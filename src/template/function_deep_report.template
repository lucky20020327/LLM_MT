Here is a deep static analysis report on this function:

​1. ​Control Flow Analysis:
{control_flow}
​2. ​Parameter Relations:
{parameter_relations}
​​3. State Mutations:​​
{state_mutations}
​4. ​Computational Properties:​​
{computational_properties}
​​5. Parameter Sensitivity:
{parameter_sensitivity}
​​6. AST Summary:

Use the static analysis report to understand the function's key characteristics:
- Control flow complexity (branches, loops)
- Parameter interactions and dependencies
- Mutation behaviors and side effects
- Algebraic properties (commutative, associative, etc.)
- Sensitive parameters and boundary conditions
Generate MRs that leverage these insights:
- For loops: consider permutations, removals, or modifications of elements
- For branches: design inputs to trigger different execution paths
- For sensitive parameters: test boundary conditions and edge cases
- For computational properties: exploit symmetry, inversion, and scaling relationships
